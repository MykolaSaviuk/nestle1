        Sweat courses down the faces of the as they sprint for the race finish on the Champs-Elysee each July, crouched
        over their handlebars, pain etched on their faces…
        <br>
        <br>

        Seen by many as the pinnacle of sporting endurance, 'Le Tour' is a race where the rider’s average 40 km/h
        over
        thousands of kilometers of challenging terrain.
        <br>
        <br>

        Eddy Merckx, who won the Tour de France four times in the 1970s, said: "Cyclers live with pain. If you can't
        handle it, you'll win nothing."
        <br>
        <br>
        You’ll also win nothing without superhuman fitness levels, good nutrition and around, of fluid on average per
        stage – the last to replace the seven liters of fluids that you lose, on average, through sweat during each
        stage.

            Of course, we’re not all scaling Alps in lycra, and you don’t have to drink this much water during your
            casual Sunday afternoon cycle or jog around the local park.
            <br>
            <br>
            All the same, adequate hydration both before and during exercise is critical for all of us. It helps
            regulate body temperature, replace fluid, and restore water levels after exercise.
            <br>
            <br>
            When the mercury climbs above 30°C, dehydration can quickly lead to a 2% loss of body weight and decreased
            endurance and skill. Dial that up to a 3%, and you’re losing muscular power and strength.
            <br>
            <br>
            The more active you are, the greater your water needs to sustain peak performance.

            <br>
            <br>
            Tour de France cyclists tend to consume water-based drinks that contain carbohydrates, electrolytes, and
            vitamins. But they are exercising extremely intensively for hours on end.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the rest of us, plain old H2O will do. We lost more water than minerals through sweat during casual
            exercise, so focus on replacing the fluids you lose with water alone.
